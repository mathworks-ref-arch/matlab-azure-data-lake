# Installation

## Installing on Windows®, macOS® and Linux

If installing based on a source code only, e.g. from GitHub then first build required jar file(s). Instructions to do can be found here: [Build](Rebuild.md). Once built the package is installed as follows.

Copy the contents of the package to the desired location. Then from within MATLAB® change directory to that location and then to the Software/MATLAB subdirectory and run the *startup.m* file. This updates the relevant paths. Output similar to the following should be shown:

![Running startup](Images/installstartup.png)

The package is now ready for use. If preferred configure MATLAB to call startup.m on startup so that the package is always available automatically. For further details see: [https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/startup.html](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/startup.html)
